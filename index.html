        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Connie and for the following 4 years, I will be a student at UCR majoring business.  Choosing UCR as my university, wasn't a decision I made in a day or a week, I had my eyes on it for a couple months before my high school exams started. Business was always close to my heart and a part of my life for as long as I can remember. From counting the change from when I was just a small kid, to making calculated, analytical decisions in every part of my life, lead me to learn more about it and to immerse myself in it. clean Predict.
The conclusion of my choice, I don't regret it even for a second. Studying at UCR wasn't only mind-opening by meeting different people across the US, but also, being able to talk about the things that interest me the most. Networking, exploring, and improving on a day-to-day basis, was something I yearned and UCR has not disappointed me. Being a student here for only 2 months, wasn't just an experience that I will look back after I finish my major, but as something, that I will always relive in my mind. Friends, classmates, and potential future colleagues that will work side-by-side with me and the opportunity to take these steps with them, is what a university should always strive towards. Projects, group assignments and break out rooms are made just for the sole purpose to come out of your comfort zone and to step into the world of unknown, with pillows and soft cushions that will ease the fall when you fall is why I'm proud to be a student at UCR. 
In the time that I studied here I not only improved myself physically, mentally, and emotionally, but I also sharpened my past forgotten skills and rebranded them into something usable and valuable. UCR does not just cover the main concepts of business it also makes you stretch out your way of thinking, by implementing different courses, that when viewed from the outside, seem unimportant and a time waste, but being through the start of it, I can say, at UCR there is nothing "useless" or "meaningless". Each course has its main key points that the lecturers want us to understand, that business is not just revolving around money and the management of it, but it is also important to understand that business is a vast subject, and it requires overall knowledge, to find the best solutions to certain problems. 
Being a kid who always dreamed big when she was little, to now being able to reach them rather than just wander and ponder, is truly amazing. Great thing about it, you don't have to do it alone. Every single student at UCR has the exclusive privilege to get in touch with every single lecturer and ask them questions on your fixated problem and the opportunity of being able to do that is limitless. Consulting, learning and always improving is the moto that every student at UCR needs to follow, because after university, every single student will be able to show, just how amazing they are at their specific major.  That's the goal I strive for and UCR couldn't be a place to realize just that.
